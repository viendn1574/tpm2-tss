.SH NAME
tcti-spi-helper \- device driver TCTI library
.SH SYNOPSIS
A TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) module for communication via SPI.
TPM device driver.
.SH DESCRIPTION
tcti-spi-helper is a library that abstracts the details of communication with a TPM
via SPI protocol. It uses user supplied methods for SPI and timing operations
in order to be platform independent. These methods are supplied to `Tss2_Tcti_Spi_Init`
via the `TSS2_TCTI_SPI_PLATFORM` struct.
